## üíª Motivation 

This web-app is not meant to replace any other Spotify web-app, rather this web app was done to further enhance my understand of interacting with APIs by using Spotify's API to link a user to their Spotify account, search songs, make a playlist in the web-app and then upload the newly made playlist to the linked account. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Technologies
- `React.js`
- `Javascript`

- `CSS`
- Spotify API Integration
  
## üõ†Ô∏è Improvements 

Use a different type of user authentication for user's to sign in via Authorization code with PKCE extension. The authorization code flow with PKCE is the recommended authorization flow for mobile apps, single-page web apps, or any type of application where the client secret can't be safely stored.
